Once GitHub is chosen, you can choose "Tweetslator" as the project
(If you wish, you can use automatic deploys, or deploy manually, depending on how you wish to use your bot)

Once setup, go to the "Settings" tab and edit the "Config Vars"

Add each of these config vars, which will be setup once you've made your Twitter Bot (developer.twitter.com, but I assume you know what you're doing!)
(You can get your SELF_ID by putting your handle (@) into any ID Finding website)

Once done, the bot will run, and should work!

# Using a custom server
